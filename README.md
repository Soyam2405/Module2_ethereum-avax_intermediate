# Module 2 ETH+AVAX INTERMEDIATE
In this I am creating a smart contract following the guidelines of module 2 of the project requirements.
In this project, I created a simple contract with 2-3 functions. Then showing the values of those functions in frontend of the application.

This project involves the creation of a basic smart contract called "Cricket" using Solidity. The contract is designed to simulate a simple cricket game with the following functionalities:


Owner Address Retrieval:
This function allows users to retrieve the address of the contract owner. It ensures transparency by displaying the address of the individual or entity that deployed the contract.

Get Score:
This function displays the total score accumulated in the game. Players can score by hitting either 4s or 6s, and the function calculates and returns the total score based on these inputs.

MetaMask Integration:
MetaMask is used to execute transactions and interact with the smart contract. Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to the application, allowing them to perform actions such as retrieving the owner address and checking the current score securely and seamlessly.

Front-End Display:
A simple front-end interface is created to display the results of the interactions with the contract. Users can view the owner address and the total score directly from the web interface, providing a user-friendly experience.
These functionalities provide a straightforward way to interact with the contract, retrieve essential information, and track the progress of the cricket game, all while ensuring secure and transparent transactions through MetaMask.

## Getting Started

### Executing program
Step-by-step guide for executing the program:

1. **Compile and Deploy Smart Contract:**
   - Open Remix IDE.
   - Compile the smart contract code.
   - Deploy the contract.

2. **Copy Contract Details:**
   - Copy the deployed contract address.
   - Copy the ABI (Application Binary Interface).

3. **Integrate with Frontend:**
   - Open our frontend application (app.jsx).
   - Paste the deployed contract address into app.jsx.
   - Integrate the ABI into app.jsx.

4. **Write Functions:**
   - Write JavaScript functions in app.jsx to interact with the smart contract's functions.

5. **Run React Application:**
   - Run the application using `npm run dev`.

6. **Connect and Interact:**
   - Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`.
   - Connect the frontend application to MetaMask.
   - Call the contract functions and execute transactions via MetaMask.

These steps should help you set up and execute your program efficiently.
